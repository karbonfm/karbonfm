# karbonfm
This is the main repo for Karbon for FileMakerâ€”a developer framework for building scalable applications in FileMaker. The application is essential a contact management system or CRM, however the true value in #karbonfm is its approach to data modeling, transactional scripting, and a rich library of custom functions that make error handling and validation a breeze. You should read the Karbon Manifesto https://www.geistinteractive.com/2018/07/30/the-karbon-manifesto/ to better understand what this project hopes to become, and jump into the conversation at https://discourse.karbon.fm.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. That's what this is all about. 

FileMaker files don't lend themselves well to Github since we can't do merges and pull requests. But we can still use Github for issues, comments, and planning.

If you find a bug, please include a copy of the file with a test that shows the bug in action if you can. Its the best way to get your issues addressed. Bugs that are clearly demonstrated are easily fixed.

If you have a bug fix, please include a copy of the file with the bug fixed; include instructions on where it is.

If you have ideas, please flesh them out in a copy of the file and include it on the issue. Nothing gets an idea across like semi-functional code.
