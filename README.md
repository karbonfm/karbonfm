## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. That's what this is all about.

FileMaker files don't lend themselves well to Github since we can't do merges and pull requests. But we can still use Github for issues, comments, and planning.

If you find a bug, please include a copy of the file with a test that shows the bug in action if you can. Its the best way to get your issues addressed. Bugs that are clearly demonstrated are easily fixed.

If you have a bug fix, please include a copy of the file with the bug fixed; include instructions on where it is.

If you have ideas, please flesh them out in a copy of the file and include it on the issue. Nothing gets an idea across like semi-functional code.
